{"name":"PHP Async Calls","tagline":"PHP Forking for API calls, Heavy IO & Big Queries","body":"PHP Async Caller\r\n===============\r\n\r\n###What it is\r\nDelegate code to the Async class to manage and fork off into a new process. Useful for executing block of code which takes\r\nless than desirable amount of time to complete - but which you don't need to know the result of. Api calls, heavy IO interaction\r\nand running maintenance are some uses for this.\r\n\r\n###Warning\r\nThis is in the vary early stages of development and executing code can be a difficult thing to achieve securely. Therefore,\r\nfor the time being, it's not advisable to use this on a production system.\r\n\r\n###How to use\r\n1. Add the library to Composer:\r\n\r\n        \"require\": {\r\n           \"eddturtle/php-async-calls\": \"dev-master\"\r\n        }\r\n2. Run `sudo composer update` in your repository\r\n3. Include the Composer autloader file: `require \"vendor/autoload.php\";`\r\n4. Start an Async queue:\r\n\r\n        $async = new Async();\r\n        $async->queue(\"sleep(10);\");\r\nRunning this in your browser should load the page in <100ms.\r\n\r\nNote: the queue will be processed once everything else on the page has been run, but can be kicked off manually by destroying\r\nthe object (aka, by `$async = null`)\r\n\r\n###Options\r\nCurrently there 5 options available. This shows the possible options you can pass into the Async() constructor and their\r\ndefault settings.\r\n\r\n* `'debug' => false` If set to true, will also print out info, like what commands are being run.\r\n* `'type' => self::TYPE_PHP` Has the option of running PHP directly or raw (TYPE_RAW) to run commands directly.\r\n* `'async' => true` You can turn off async (useful for testing and seeing the affect).\r\n* `'tmp-dir' => '/tmp/'` The directory to store temp files, needs write access.\r\n* `'cleanup' => true` Whether to clean up the tmp-dir after it's been used.\r\n\r\n###In the pipeline (future work)\r\n* Work closely with curl requests.\r\n* Logging to check result.\r\n\r\n###Licence\r\nLicenced under the MIT Licence, as attached in the project.\r\n","google":"UA-2966413-11","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
